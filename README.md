- ## **Creational Design Pattern**

<details>  
<summary>Structural Design Pattern </summary>
  
  Structural design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures. They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system     doesn’t need to change, promoting flexibility and efficiency.

  ### **Pros and Cons**
  Structural design patterns come with their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons:

  <details>  
  <summary>Pros</summary>
    
  - **Flexibility and Reusability:**
  
    Promote the reuse of existing components by allowing them to work together, even if their interfaces are incompatible.
  - **Decoupling**:
  
    Help decouple interfaces from implementations, making it easier to change one without affecting the other. This leads to more maintainable code.
  - **Scalability**:
  
    Support the addition of new functionalities without altering existing code, making it easier to scale applications.
  - **Improved Collaboration**:
  
    Facilitate collaboration between different systems and classes that may not have been designed to work together.
  - **Clearer Structure**:
  
    Provide a clear way to organize code, especially in complex systems, which enhances readability and understanding.

  <details>
  <summary>Cons</summary>
    
  - **Complexity:**
  
    Can introduce additional layers of abstraction, which may make the system more complex and harder to understand, especially for new developers.
  - **Performance Overhead:**
  
    The added layers (like adapters) can introduce performance overhead, which may be critical in performance-sensitive applications.
  - **Learning Curve:**
  
    Understanding and implementing structural patterns may require a deeper understanding of design principles, which can pose a challenge for less experienced developers.
  - **Over-Engineering:**
  
    There’s a risk of over-engineering a solution by introducing patterns that may not be necessary for simpler problems.
  - **Maintenance:**
  
    If not used judiciously, the added complexity can lead to maintenance challenges, particularly if the patterns are misapplied or overused.
