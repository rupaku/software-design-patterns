# Composite Design Pattern


## Composite Example UML Diagram

![Composite Pattern Use Case UML Diagram](../../img/composite_example.svg)

## Overview

- Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

## When to Use

- when you have to implement a tree-like object structure.
- when you want the client code to treat both simple and complex elements uniformly.

## Pros 

- You can work with complex tree structures more conveniently: use polymorphism and recursion to your advantage.
- Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new element types into the app without breaking the existing code, which now works with the object tree.

## Cons

- It might be difficult to provide a common interface for classes whose functionality differs too much. In certain scenarios, youâ€™d need to overgeneralize the component interface, making it harder to comprehend.

## Output

``` bash
python ./composite/composite_concept.py
